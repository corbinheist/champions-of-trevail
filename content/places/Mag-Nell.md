# Mag Nell

Located north of Trevall, relations between the two are practically non-existent due to the difficulty of reaching one another. A rough and savage place, Mag Nell is mostly mountainous terrain with a few scattered forests. It's only livable settlement is [[Vorveilen]], the Last True Kingdom of Man. More citadel than city, Vorveilen has long held against the savage hordes that constantly assail it. Over two hundred clans live in the massive city, some with hundreds of members and others with only a dozen. Remnants of the barbarian tribes that built Vorveilen, each clan has a single representative in the [[Assembly]] and their own intrinsic laws in addition to Vorveilen's basic ones. One clan might punish a liar with fifty lashes while another may spend their days creating breathtaking art only for the clan head to destroy it for being imperfect.
  
Mag Nell also has some of the greatest living warriors, who must often prove their mettle by traveling through [[the Outposts]]. The land outside of the Vorveilen is known as [[the Black Forest]], with only small outposts providing any kind of safe haven. Underground farms and fishing boats provide much of Vorveilen's food, but many resources can only be found in the Black and skilled Initiators always accompany the gathering parties.
