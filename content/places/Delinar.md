# Delinar

Delinar is Trevails age old enemy, vastly richer and more prosperous. A Theocracy that worships the Natural Trinity.


Trevall's age old enemy, Delinar lies to the south of them and is always trying to expand. A theocracy who worships the natural trinity of Heart, Fang, and Eye, they bear more divine magic than all other nations combined and they're not shy about using it. Using chains of gold they enslave a multitude of outsiders and force them to do their dirty work, a fact hidden from most citizens. Surprisingly, most members of the church do not abuse their positions besides against each other. Most of their citizenry eagerly do all they can to help Delinar expand, seeing their aggressive grabs for power as merely spreading true civilization. It helps that life in Delinar is quite good, with divine magic providing both food and healing.
  
There are three gods in the Natural Trinity. Heart is the goddess of life, birth, death, and fate. Her followers are usually clerics who channel positive energy. Fang is the god of battle, strength, blood, and beasts. His followers are usually warpriests who either lead contingents in the royal army or protect the land much like Knights do. Eye is the god of knowledge, shadows, luck, travel, and civilization. His followers are usually Inquisitors who insure heretics are rooted out and Delinar itself runs smoothly.
