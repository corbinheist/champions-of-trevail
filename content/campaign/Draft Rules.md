# Draft Rules

> These are rules that are works-in-progress

#### Size as Armor

> I really like the Idea of Size being a major factor in dealing damage, ect that was a HUGE impact on how we handled fights in Eric's last campaign... There are probably a few ways to handle this and I would like to experiment with a few.

- Player Character Races Start as Size-1
- 1 Armor for every size difference between attacker and defender
- AP only ignores half of this bonus armor*
	- Might need to play with this modifier to balance fights appropriately
- ==This Idea needs some work==
  - Maybe lair actions and legendary resistances from [[Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition]]
- Smaller Sizes have *an advantage* at fighting in closer quarters. Targeting Range?

#### Debilities and Healing

> Make Healing (in general) a bit harder
