# Trevail Session 0

> An Ambush gone Awry...


Bartholem is running a successful racket, Fencing, Protection and Banditry. He has also recently blackmailed the Council of Vorveilen Goddard 'The Cloak'.

Rhukaan has been hired as a guard for a supplies caravan through the notorious Outposts. 
Aruthi, Vrakk and Frayn are also on this caravan, seeking answers to a rumor of a source of great evil present nearby.

Dripp is a spy working for Bartholem, he's the one who uncovered the leverage for Goddard.

We Join the party about 1/4 days' ride away from the Outpost torn of Vittis. Where Bartholems mercenary band ~~gang~~ have surrounded the caravan and being extorting them. Frayn steps forward, and Dripp moves to stop him from getting closer. As he reaches into the darkness, Sketal hands burst from the ground in the immediate area, and several skeletal figures claw their way from the depths - Rusty Blade, Spear, and Axe in hand.

Rhukkan thrums with an arcane energy, his blade glowing and emitting powerful arcane vibrations.

A Beast in the forest roars. It's howl like the shreik of a hundred claws being dragged across a slate board, causing the Trees and Skeletons to vibrate.

*End Session*
