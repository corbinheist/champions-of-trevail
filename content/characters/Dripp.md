## Moves

### Conjuration

### Gather Darkness

### Dark, Dark Hands

### Monstrous Heritage

#### Bloody Appetites
> (Adapted from “Herculean Appetites”, Insatiable, pg 464)  

When you pursue one of the appetites of the Black Blood, if you would roll for a move,  
instead of rolling 2d6 you roll 1d6+1d8. If the d6 is the higher die of the pair, the GM will also  
introduce a complication or danger that comes about due to your heedless pursuits.  
Choose two Appetites:  
- Conquest
- Power over others  

#### Stay Out of the Light

> (adapted from “Stay out of the Light”, Shadow, pg 379)  

When you hide in shadows or darkness, you cannot be detected by any normal means  
until you reveal yourself.  
From the Shadows (Adapted From “Like a Ghost”, Shadow, pg 380)  
When you roll for another move that you want to perform in a clandestine manner, you  
may choose options equal to your DEX or less (but not fewer than none), and then tell the other players:  
- How you draw attention elsewhere instead of to you.  
- How you stay out of sight.  
- That you remain silent.  
- Why you leave no trace behind  
On a 10+, all that you say is true. On a 7-9, the GM chooses one of your statements to be false,  
the others are true. On a miss, no guarantees.  

### Ancestral Heritage  
You have a mixed heritage. Decide on your species, ethnicity, and  
cultural heritage, choosing anything or any combination of things that sounds interesting to you.  
Then choose up to three heritage moves to start with, from the monster moves that best match  
your heritage. How do you honor your people and invoke your rights  
of blood and tradition? Choose one:  
- Sacrifice  

### Blood and Tradition  
At the beginning of a session, or when you invoke your rights  
of blood and tradition, roll+WIS. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9,  
hold 2. On a miss, you still hold 1. Spend a hold to make a heritage  
move, just like that

## Beast of the Black Blood  

Long ago, a bloodmage infused himself with great power and corrupted his blood. The  
sorcerer was defeated, but some of his blood survived. For centuries it has spread itself,  
replicating in secret, corrupting everything it can. Here is a piece, a drop split from the whole,  
sent to spread itself and ensure the survival of its kind. Instinct: to Consume. Special Qualities:  
Amorphous  
● Form a useful adaptation from the Black Blood  
● Spread the taint of the Black Blood  
● Hide in darkness  
● Consume Flesh to Heal
