### Consult Sage

### Buddy Movie

-   When they help you fight, you deal +1d4 damage.

### Heritage (Hill Troll)

Enforce your people’s code of honor. (“Evil must never be ignored by those with strength.”)

#### Regeneration

[Troll - Special Qualities: Regeneration; adapted from “Psychic Surgery”]

When you concentrate on healing yourself, roll+CON. On a 10+, you heal 1d8 damage or remove one disease. On a 7-9, you heal 1d4 damage.

#### Hurl Large Object

[Troll - Hurl something or someone; adapted from “Metal Hurlant”]

When you attack by hurling a large object, choose a target and roll+CON. On a 10+, your target takes 1d10 damage and is stunned. On a 7-9, you still damage your target, but the GM will choose an additional target nearby.

#### Hide Like Iron

[Troll - Undo the effects of an attack (unless caused by a weakness, your call); adapted from “Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken”]
