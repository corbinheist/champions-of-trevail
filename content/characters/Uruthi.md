Other Effects/Hold to Track:

When you use your psychic powers, you may roll with WIS instead of INT.

## Moves

### Telekinesis


### Truth and Consequences

### Devotion
Choose up to three spheres of influence (but always at least one) that your devotion gives you special insight into:
- Time


### Rewrite reality

You may spend a hold to immediately reroll your last roll. You must take the second result. If you do so pick one but not the other

- You do not begin a butterfly effect
- Outside powers do not notice your meddling

### Unleash chaos from containment

You may spend a hold to exert your will in a circle around yourself. As long as you continue to concentrate you unleash chaos in the world around you (the earth below your feet begins breaking apart, fires break out, storms break out around you, etc). If you take any other action or cease concentration the effects immediately cease.

### Act with perfect foresight

Spend 1 hold to receive +1 forward on your next roll involving people, groups, or social institutions from Truth and Consequences.

### Blood and Tradition

### Ancestral Heritage - Lower Depths
How do you honour your people and invoke your rights of blood and tradition?

- Sacrifice.

## Spells

## Gear & Encumbrance

- Bag of books (5 uses, 2 weight).
- dungeon rations (5 uses, 1 weight)
- Chainmail (1 armour, 1 weight)
- Staff (close, two-handed, 1 weight)
