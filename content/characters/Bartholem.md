## Moves

### Entourage 

Your entourage is composed of hardy dwarves, add +1 fighting.

You can surround yourself with up to a dozen or so minions who will back you up, follow your orders, impress  
people, and help you conduct your business. Choose what type of people compose your entourage:  
Seasoned Mercenaries: Dissent +1, Eloquence +1, Fighting +2, Learning +0.  
You can order individuals around like hirelings if you want them to do things other than act as part of your  
entourage. If they are obedient servants, take +1 to order them. If they are noble courtiers, take -1 to order them.  
Accoutrements  
Finery and riches, and many weapons  
Skill  
Soldiering  
Weakness  
Dead inside


Ex Officio  
When you’re surrounded by your entourage...  
...and you attack the same target, add both their dissent and their fighting to your damage.  
...and you defend the same target, add their fighting to your roll.  
...and you parley, add their eloquence to your roll.  
...and you spout lore, add their learning to your roll.  
...and someone interferes with you, add your entourage’s dissent to their roll.
