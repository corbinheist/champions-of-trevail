Darkness is rising across multiple fronts. Rifts open Old Alliances falter, the once-powerful nations are reduced to city-states and vassal states. Nations fall into isolationism and corruption. Brigands or worse roam the borderlands inbetween. Corruption and Insanity are constant dangers. Grimdark Fantasy, expect hard choices and grey tasks and everything has a price - but this is still fantasy. Explore the remanints of the great empires of the epoch of legends, long over-grown and reclaimed by nature. A world dominated by powerful entities, all of whom have carved out their own niches in the lands that were once an empire. The Setting is still experiencing the upheavals of the past age, and the very fabric of the world seems to be in a constant state of flux. Whole mountain ranges move like ships on a great sea, exposing the inner workings of the universe via great rifts they leave behind.\n6 Truths # The Calamatous downfall of THE EMPIRE Nature Factions # The players as a group are all members of, or associated with,\nThis will be a major part of session-0 Character Creation # Guidelines # Class Warfare Characters # You get 2 specialties at first level.

Heritage # I wanted to find a middle ground between only allowing 2 specialties and the full 3. Its my hope that this drives some world-building and inspires some creative problem solving!\nthe world is diverse and wild, full of many cultures. You get the Monstorous Heritage Compendium Class at 1st Level. We\u0026rsquo;re just going to call this \u0026lsquo;Heritage\u0026rsquo;, aka you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a Monster. Unique Monsters, Unique Challenges: # You didn\u0026rsquo;t think you were getting something for nothing did you? I\u0026rsquo;m taking inspiration from the Witcher here\u0026hellip; Think geralt going up against anything more powerful than a soldier. It requires knowledge, preparation, skill, and sometimes a healthy dose of luck.\nPowerful monsters, creatures, beings will need in-world knowledge to defeat under most circumstances.

You may acquire a 3rd speciality by meeting the requirements of that compendium/prestige class. Use EXP as a currency (i.e. Runes from [[Elden Ring]]) EXP can be a requirement for Enchanting, Ritual Magic It can also be spent to influence a roll, as if fate is intervening. Be careful as this comes at a cost. (DM gets +1 hold for a Hard Move against your character) Bonds and EXP Triggers EXP Triggers to replace (or supplement?) the usual post-session EXP? 3+ 1/3 * Level Triggers? Might need some adjustment to get this number right Zone-Based Combat: # Might try out some Isometric maps for bigger setpieces. I want to provide more detail for players to interact with their environment and inspire creative solutions. Movement between zones might require defying danger, using movement/abilities ect\u0026hellip; This ties into weapon tags [Close], [Near], [Far] Size as Armor # Player Character Races Start as Size-0 1 Armor for every size difference between attacker and defender AP only ignores half of this bonus armor* Might need to play with this modifier to balance fights appropriately ==This Idea needs some work== Maybe lair actions and legendary resistances from [[Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition]] Debilities and Healing # Downtime # Downtime will be handled Asynchronously.
