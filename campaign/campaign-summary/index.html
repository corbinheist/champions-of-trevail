  About The Setting of Trevail
  <a class="anchor" href="#about-the-setting-of-trevail">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trevail is a loose coalition of semi-independent duchies and baronies, most of whom only pay lip-service to the Crown. Each &lsquo;year&rsquo; the duchies send delegations to the Assembly. An assembly member is elected as the Speaker of that <em>instance</em> of the Assembly.</li>
<li>The Knightly Orders of Trevail exist outside the usual government structures of the duchies, answering only to their own codes.</li>
<li>A number of great beasts stalk the lands of Trevall, from Chimeras to Manticores and Gorgons to Hydras. Though most are content to simply steal a few sheep, others make a strong habit of attacking any human they come across. More than anything else these monsters are the targets of Knights, both to gain prestige and the usual high bounty on their heads.</li>
<li>Trevail was once the site of a great civilization, with a great number of Undead festering under its rocks and chasms. Undeath is not necessarily an evil act, with several Duchies under the dominion of powerful Undead.</li>
<li>The Fey make their home in the Wyld Border, set between the mortal plane and primordial nothingness. An elfs word is law, which acts as a self imposed Geas - only lifted on the mortal plane.</li>
<li>The Giants oppose the Fey and seek to keep the Wyld Border at bay.</li>
<li>The Dhakkani (Goblinoids) were once the masters of a great empire, manipulated into a war between the Primordia and Dragons. Their Culture is broken, scattered, and leaderless. Clinging to their old ways, and forced to the edges of civilization.</li>
<li>Mag Nell is A rough and savage place, Mag Nell is mostly mountainous terrain with a few scattered forests. It&rsquo;s only livable settlement is <a href="app://obsidian.md/Vorveilen">Vorveilen</a>, the Last True Kingdom of Man. Mag Nell also has some of the greatest living warriors, who must often prove their mettle by traveling through <a href="app://obsidian.md/the%20Outposts">the Outposts</a>. The land outside of the Vorveilen is known as <a href="app://obsidian.md/the%20Black%20Forest">the Black Forest</a>, with only small outposts providing any kind of safe haven.</li>
<li>Delinar is Trevails age old enemy, vastly richer and more prosperous. A Theocracy that worships the Natural Trinity.</li>
<li>Their is only one true power in the eastern continent of Tor and that is dragons. The Draconis League comprise the entirety of the Empire, each city state ruling themselves since the great dragon Arvishondex disappeared over a century ago. Each dragon is tied to every drake touched citizen, with normal humanity being bred out of the average bloodline ten thousand odd years ago.</li>

</h4>
<ul>
<li>You get 2 specialties at first level. (+ Heritage, See below)</li>
<li>Choose a primary Archetype if you multiclass, this works as your base Archetype. Multiclassing follows the same rules as core-Class Warfare otherwise (in terms of damage die, HP, ect&hellip;)</li>
<li>You may acquire a 3rd speciality by meeting the requirements of that compendium class.</li>
<li>Any &lsquo;Racial&rsquo; option from your chosen Archetype/Specialty may be selected at Character Creation</li>
<li>Some specialities may be acquired only through compendium class requirements (&lsquo;Prestige Classes&rsquo;)</li>
<li>Note: You don’t get the ‘Free’ outside-archetype/specialization moves. You must meet the Requirements of those Prestige/Compendium classes to take those moves.</li>
<li>Adventurer/&lsquo;The Fool&rsquo; (aka Luck) is ONLY available as a Prestige/Compendium Class. If you happen to have an extraordinarily lucky (or unlucky) set of rolls during a session or campaign, that might become available to your character.</li>

<p>I wanted to find a middle ground between only allowing 2 specialties and the full 3. Its my hope that this drives some world-building and inspires some creative problem solving!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the world is diverse and wild, full of many cultures.</li>
<li>You get the Monstrous Heritage Compendium Class at 1st Level. We&rsquo;re just going to call this &lsquo;Heritage&rsquo;, aka you don&rsquo;t have to be a Monster.</li>
<li>Heritage/Blood and Tradition (Move) may be keyed off of a mental stat (Wis, Int, Cha) of your choosing.</li>

I&rsquo;m taking inspiration from the Witcher here&hellip; Think geralt going up against anything more powerful than a soldier. It requires knowledge, preparation, skill, and sometimes a healthy dose of luck.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Powerful monsters, creatures, beings will need in-world knowledge to defeat under most circumstances.</li>
<li>(See Advantage) Some Legendary beings are so powerful that they defy conventional approaches. You&rsquo;ll need an advantage against them to even have a chance.</li>

</h4>
<ul>
<li>I want this game and world to be collaborative and improvisational with you, the players.</li>
<li>Expect rolls, and ad-hoc rulings. I will do my best to maintain a running list of rulings and decisions so that we can maintain consistency.</li>
<li>Some House-Rules might need adjustment during play to better suit the pacing and power-scaling of the campaign. We&rsquo;ll do this as needed and retcon where appropriate.</li>
<li>Expect Debilities, Ability Checks and other things that might make Single Attribute Dependency a dangerous risk</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I have a few other house-rules that I am working on, and might introduce into the campaign. Those will be updated here and players will get the chance to retcon as necessary to adapt to those changes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Advantage: Success shifts one &lsquo;grade&rsquo; better. You can achieve success beyond what is humanly possible.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>You may acquire a 3rd speciality by meeting the requirements of that compendium/prestige class. Standard Multiclassing rules apply.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use EXP as a currency (i.e. Runes from [[Elden Ring]])
<ul>
<li>EXP can be a requirement for Enchanting, Ritual Magic, Dealing with the Gods, ect&hellip;</li>
<li>It can also be spent to influence a roll, as if fate is intervening. Be careful as this comes at a cost.</li>
