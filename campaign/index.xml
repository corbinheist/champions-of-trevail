      <description>Campaign - Introduction # Trevail # Trevail is a land of Upheaval, Broken by the arcane machinations of an age long past - that still grasps at this world in alien ways. The Land is literally broken in places, crevasses and canyons that descend beyond the depths and into the arcane maelstrom that powers the world. Grimdark Fantasy, expect hard choices and grey tasks and everything has a price - but this is still fantasy.</description>
