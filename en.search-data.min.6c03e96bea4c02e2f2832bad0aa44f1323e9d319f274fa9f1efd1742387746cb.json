The Land is literally broken in places, crevasses and canyons that descend beyond the depths and into the arcane maelstrom that powers the world. Grimdark Fantasy, expect hard choices and grey tasks and everything has a price - but this is still fantasy. See Grimdark Fantasy page for more Links Civilization has made great strides, but the wilds between settlements are still dangerous and unpredictable. The common person generally requires protection to survive. All forms of Magic: Blade, Arcane, Mind, and Divine are connected to the same source, the great arcane machines that power the world. Your honor and how you\u0026rsquo;re perceived as of great import in Trevall. Further Truths about the campaign world will be revealed during our Session-0, as the characters are introduced\u0026hellip;\nAbout The Setting of Trevail # Trevail is a loose coalition of semi-independent duchies and baronies, most of whom only pay lip-service to the Crown. Each \u0026lsquo;year\u0026rsquo; the duchies send delegations to the Assembly. An assembly member is elected as the Speaker of that instance of the Assembly. The Knightly Orders of Trevail exist outside the usual government structures of the duchies, answering only to their own codes. A number of great beasts stalk the lands of Trevall, from Chimeras to Manticores and Gorgons to Hydras. Though most are content to simply steal a few sheep, others make a strong habit of attacking any human they come across. More than anything else these monsters are the targets of Knights, both to gain prestige and the usual high bounty on their heads. Trevail was once the site of a great civilization, with a great number of Undead festering under its rocks and chasms. Undeath is not necessarily an evil act, with several Duchies under the dominion of powerful Undead. The Fey make their home in the Wyld Border, set between the mortal plane and primordial nothingness. An elfs word is law, which acts as a self imposed Geas - only lifted on the mortal plane. The Giants oppose the Fey and seek to keep the Wyld Border at bay. The Dhakkani (Goblinoids) were once the masters of a great empire, manipulated into a war between the Primordia and Dragons. Their Culture is broken, scattered, and leaderless. Clinging to their old ways, and forced to the edges of civilization. Mag Nell is A rough and savage place, Mag Nell is mostly mountainous terrain with a few scattered forests. It\u0026rsquo;s only livable settlement is Vorveilen, the Last True Kingdom of Man. Mag Nell also has some of the greatest living warriors, who must often prove their mettle by traveling through the Outposts. The land outside of the Vorveilen is known as the Black Forest, with only small outposts providing any kind of safe haven. Delinar is Trevails age old enemy, vastly richer and more prosperous. A Theocracy that worships the Natural Trinity. Their is only one true power in the eastern continent of Tor and that is dragons. The Draconis League comprise the entirety of the Empire, each city state ruling themselves since the great dragon Arvishondex disappeared over a century ago. Each dragon is tied to every drake touched citizen, with normal humanity being bred out of the average bloodline ten thousand odd years ago. Factions # The players as a group are all members of, or associated with, This will be a major part of session-0\u0026hellip; Here are a few ideas\u0026hellip;\nKnightly Orders The Assembly and Machinations of the Crown Fey Courts and Geas The Dhakkani Empire The Great Beasts Character Creation # Guidelines # Character Creation # Trying this out\u0026hellip; A super minimal way to ask \u0026lsquo;character questions\u0026rsquo;, give you a way to describe your character, and help inspire me for some creative\u0026hellip; complications or results.\nPick 3 Adjectives to describe your character\u0026rsquo;s personality. Pick 2 Adjectives to describe your character\u0026rsquo;s physical appearance and mannerisms. Be prepared to answer the following Questions: How do you Explore a new place? How do you interact with others? What about someone who challenges your viewpoint of the world? How do you fight? HERE IS A TEMPLATE CHARACTER SHEET\nClass Warfare Characters* # You get 2 specialties at first level. (+ Heritage, See below) Choose a primary Archetype if you multiclass, this works as your base Archetype. Multiclassing follows the same rules as core-Class Warfare otherwise (in terms of damage die, HP, ect\u0026hellip;) You may acquire a 3rd speciality by meeting the requirements of that compendium class. Any \u0026lsquo;Racial\u0026rsquo; option from your chosen Archetype/Specialty may be selected at Character Creation Some specialities may be acquired only through compendium class requirements (\u0026lsquo;Prestige Classes\u0026rsquo;) Note: You don’t get the ‘Free’ outside-archetype/specialization moves. You must meet the Requirements of those Prestige/Compendium classes to take those moves. Adventurer/\u0026lsquo;The Fool\u0026rsquo; (aka Luck) is ONLY available as a Prestige/Compendium Class. If you happen to have an extraordinarily lucky (or unlucky) set of rolls during a session or campaign, that might become available to your character. Heritage # I wanted to find a middle ground between only allowing 2 specialties and the full 3. Its my hope that this drives some world-building and inspires some creative problem solving!\nthe world is diverse and wild, full of many cultures. You get the Monstrous Heritage Compendium Class at 1st Level. We\u0026rsquo;re just going to call this \u0026lsquo;Heritage\u0026rsquo;, aka you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a Monster. Heritage/Blood and Tradition (Move) may be keyed off of a mental stat (Wis, Int, Cha) of your choosing. Heritage Counts as your base specialty for purposes of multiclassing. Unique Monsters, Unique Challenges: # You didn\u0026rsquo;t think you were getting something for nothing did you? I\u0026rsquo;m taking inspiration from the Witcher here\u0026hellip; Think geralt going up against anything more powerful than a soldier. It requires knowledge, preparation, skill, and sometimes a healthy dose of luck.\nPowerful monsters, creatures, beings will need in-world knowledge to defeat under most circumstances. (See Advantage) Some Legendary beings are so powerful that they defy conventional approaches. You\u0026rsquo;ll need an advantage against them to even have a chance. House-rules # Miscellaneous Notes # I want this game and world to be collaborative and improvisational with you, the players. Expect rolls, and ad-hoc rulings. I will do my best to maintain a running list of rulings and decisions so that we can maintain consistency. Some House-Rules might need adjustment during play to better suit the pacing and power-scaling of the campaign. We\u0026rsquo;ll do this as needed and retcon where appropriate. Expect Debilities, Ability Checks and other things that might make Single Attribute Dependency a dangerous risk Note: I have a few other house-rules that I am working on, and might introduce into the campaign. Those will be updated here and players will get the chance to retcon as necessary to adapt to those changes.\nAdvantage and Disadvantage # Advantage: Success shifts one \u0026lsquo;grade\u0026rsquo; better. You can achieve success beyond what is humanly possible. Disadvantage: Success shifts one \u0026lsquo;grade\u0026rsquo; worse. Prepare for hard choices. Very bad things happen when you fail while disadvantaged. Level-Up Characters: # Have a quick roundtable discussion when characters level up. What\u0026rsquo;s your roadmap/plan? What did you get this level? Where do you see your character going from there? You may acquire a 3rd speciality by meeting the requirements of that compendium/prestige class. Standard Multiclassing rules apply. Use EXP as a currency (i.e. Runes from [[Elden Ring]]) EXP can be a requirement for Enchanting, Ritual Magic, Dealing with the Gods, ect\u0026hellip; It can also be spent to influence a roll, as if fate is intervening. Be careful as this comes at a cost. Bonds and EXP Triggers EXP Triggers to replace (or supplement?) the usual post-session EXP? 3+ 1/3 * Level Triggers? Might need some adjustment to get this number right Zone-Based Combat: # I Might try out some Isometric maps for bigger set-pieces. I want to provide more detail for players to interact with their environment and inspire creative solutions. Movement between zones will require defying danger, using movement/abilities ect\u0026hellip; This ties into weapon tags [Close], [Near], [Far] Downtime # Downtime will be handled Asynchronously. When the Party/Characters are in a safe spot, we will handle this between sessions, and provide the other players a quick summary at the beginning of the session.\nReferences # Resources/Sources # [[Dungeon World]] [[Class Warfare]] [[The_Perilous_Wilds.pdf]] [[Trevail Campaign Setting]] one-page-campaign-guide\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/champions-of-trevail/characters/bartholem/","title":"Bartholem","section":"Characters","content":"Bartholem\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/champions-of-trevail/characters/dripp/","title":"Dripp","section":"Characters","content":"Dripp\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/champions-of-trevail/notes/dice-statistics/","title":"Dice Statistics","section":"Notes","content":" Dice Statistics # Here is an intersting link on commonly rolled dice-pairs for Dungeon World\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/champions-of-trevail/notes/grimdark-fantasy/","title":"Grimdark Fantasy","section":"Notes","content":" Grimdark Fantasy # Check out these links for More Reading on Grimdark and its place in the Fantasy Spectrum\nWhat is Grimdark\nBeware of Heroes - A Guide to Grimdark\nIs it Grimdark or is it Horror?\nHeroic, Realistic, and Grimdark – the Shades of Fantasy\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/champions-of-trevail/notes/session-0-follow-up-questions/","title":"Session 0 Follow Up Questions","section":"Notes","content":"Session 0 - Follow Up Questions\n@ALL # I Forgot to bring this up, and with the audio issues we had I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to hear the detailed responses anyways.\nIf you find a nice Avatar/Illustration of your character, please send it to me and I\u0026rsquo;ll add it to your Characters page on the website 🙂 Please answer these Questions about your character.

A Theocracy that worships the Natural Trinity.\nTrevall\u0026rsquo;s age old enemy, Delinar lies to the south of them and is always trying to expand. A theocracy who worships the natural trinity of Heart, Fang, and Eye, they bear more divine magic than all other nations combined and they\u0026rsquo;re not shy about using it. Using chains of gold they enslave a multitude of outsiders and force them to do their dirty work, a fact hidden from most citizens. Surprisingly, most members of the church do not abuse their positions besides against each other. Most of their citizenry eagerly do all they can to help Delinar expand, seeing their aggressive grabs for power as merely spreading true civilization. It helps that life in Delinar is quite good, with divine magic providing both food and healing.\nThere are three gods in the Natural Trinity. Heart is the goddess of life, birth, death, and fate. Her followers are usually clerics who channel positive energy. Fang is the god of battle, strength, blood, and beasts. His followers are usually warpriests who either lead contingents in the royal army or protect the land much like Knights do. Eye is the god of knowledge, shadows, luck, travel, and civilization. His followers are usually Inquisitors who insure heretics are rooted out and Delinar itself runs smoothly.\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/champions-of-trevail/places/mag-nell/","title":"Mag Nell","section":"Places","content":" Mag Nell # Located north of Trevall, relations between the two are practically non-existent due to the difficulty of reaching one another.
