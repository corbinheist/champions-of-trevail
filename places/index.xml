      <description>Delinar # Delinar is Trevails age old enemy, vastly richer and more prosperous. A Theocracy that worships the Natural Trinity.
Trevall&amp;rsquo;s age old enemy, Delinar lies to the south of them and is always trying to expand. A theocracy who worships the natural trinity of Heart, Fang, and Eye, they bear more divine magic than all other nations combined and they&amp;rsquo;re not shy about using it. Using chains of gold they enslave a multitude of outsiders and force them to do their dirty work, a fact hidden from most citizens.</description>

      <description>Mag Nell # Located north of Trevall, relations between the two are practically non-existent due to the difficulty of reaching one another. A rough and savage place, Mag Nell is mostly mountainous terrain with a few scattered forests. It&amp;rsquo;s only livable settlement is [[Vorveilen]], the Last True Kingdom of Man. More citadel than city, Vorveilen has long held against the savage hordes that constantly assail it. Over two hundred clans live in the massive city, some with hundreds of members and others with only a dozen.</description>
